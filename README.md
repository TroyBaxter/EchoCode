# EchoCode 
IDK really what to put here. Basically, Echo Code is a python based programming language for absolute beginners to learn the basics of text based programming. 

###   Notes   ###
.  File extention for echo code is .ech

.  I do know alot of this is hard coded and hard to understand, but more consise and (cant think of the word) versions are coming soon

. The pause command was removed because of a bug where if the command was used anywhere in the script, the Makesound command simply wouldnt function

###   Current commands   ###
  
  
  makesound:
    basically winsound.Beep(), except just put the tone on the end.
    for example:
      makesound 1000
    would be winsound.Beep(1000, 100 #default setting#)
  
  
  print:
    usage:
      print hello world!!!
      OUTPUT: hello world!!!
  
  
  math:
    basically just the print command except with +,-,* or /.
    usage:
      math 1+1
      OUTPUT: 2
