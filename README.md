# EchoCode
IDK really what to put here. Basically, Echo Code is a python based programming language for absolute beginners to learn the basics of text based programming. 

Current commands:
  makesound:
    basically winsound.Beep(), except just put the tone on the end.
    for example:
      makesound 1000
    would be winsound.Beep(1000, 100 #default setting#)
  print:
    usage:
      print hello world!!!
      OUTPUT: hello world!!!
  math:
    basically just the print command except with +,-,* or /.
    usage:
      math 1+1
      OUTPUT: 2
